Company Settings is your central control panel for everything about how your organization operates on EasyBiller. From your company name and logo to payment integrations and notification preferences, this is where you configure it all.

## Billing configuration

Billing configuration controls how your bills are calculated, when billing cycles run, and how tariffs are applied. Because billing is central to your operations, this section has its own dedicated guide.

**For full billing setup instructions**, see [Company Setup (Water Billing)](/water-billing/company-setup/).

Here is a summary of what you configure:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Billing cycle** | Monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly cycle with configurable start dates |
| **Tariff structure** | Flat rate, tiered, or block pricing per unit of consumption |
| **Minimum charge** | A base charge applied to every bill regardless of consumption |
| **Standing charge** | A fixed service fee added to each billing cycle |
| **Tax rate** | VAT or other applicable tax percentage |
| **Late payment penalty** | Percentage or fixed amount charged for overdue bills |
| **Grace period** | Number of days after bill date before a payment is considered overdue |

:::caution[Changes affect future bills only]
Modifying billing configuration applies to the next billing cycle. Already-generated bills are not retroactively changed. If you need to correct a past bill, use the bill adjustment feature in [Generating Bills](/water-billing/generating-bills/).
:::

## Payment settings

Payment settings control how your customers pay and how those payments are recorded in the system.

### M-Pesa integration

M-Pesa is a popular payment method. To receive payments via M-Pesa, you need to configure your paybill or till number.

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Company Settings > Payments**.
  2. Under **M-Pesa Configuration**, click **"Configure"**.
  3. Enter the following details:
     - **Paybill number** or **Till number** — your Safaricom business number
     - **Account reference format** — how customers identify themselves (for example, account number or meter number)
     - **Consumer key** and **Consumer secret** — your Daraja API credentials from the [Safaricom Developer Portal](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/)
     - **Passkey** — provided by Safaricom for Lipa Na M-Pesa Online
     - **Callback URL** — automatically generated by EasyBiller (do not change unless instructed by support)
  4. Click **"Test Connection"** to verify the credentials work.
  5. Click **"Save"**.
</Steps>

:::note[API credentials]
You obtain your Daraja API credentials by creating an app on the Safaricom Developer Portal and going live. If you have not done this before, your admin or IT team can follow [Safaricom's Daraja documentation](https://developer.safaricom.co.ke/Documentation).
:::

### Manual payment recording

Even with M-Pesa integration, you may need to record cash payments, bank transfers, or cheque payments manually. Manual payment recording is always available and does not require any configuration.

See [Recording Payments](/water-billing/payments/) for the full payment workflow.

### Currency settings

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Company Settings > Payments**.
  2. Under **Currency**, select your currency from the dropdown.
  3. Click **"Save"**.
</Steps>

The selected currency symbol appears on all bills, receipts, and financial reports.

## SMS settings

SMS notifications keep your customers informed about bills, payments, and service updates. EasyBiller integrates with **Africa's Talking** for SMS delivery.

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Company Settings > Notifications > SMS**.
  2. Enter your Africa's Talking credentials:
     - **Username** — your Africa's Talking account username
     - **API Key** — from the Africa's Talking dashboard
     - **Sender ID** — your registered alphanumeric sender name (for example, "MajiWater"). If you do not have a registered sender ID, messages are sent from a shared short code.
  3. Click **"Test SMS"** to send a test message to your own phone number.
  4. If the test arrives, click **"Save"**.
</Steps>

For detailed notification configuration (what triggers an SMS, template customization, and troubleshooting), see [Notifications](/account/notifications/).

:::caution[SMS costs]
Each SMS sent deducts from your Africa's Talking balance. Monitor your balance regularly in the Africa's Talking dashboard to avoid service interruption. EasyBiller does not manage your SMS balance — you top up directly with Africa's Talking.
:::

## Email notification settings

Email notifications are sent for events like bill generation, payment confirmation, and account invitations.

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Company Settings > Notifications > Email**.
  2. Configure the following:
     - **From name** — the name that appears in the "From" field (for example, "Maji Water Billing")
     - **Reply-to email** — where customer replies are directed
  3. Toggle individual notification types on or off (see [Notifications](/account/notifications/) for the full list).
  4. Click **"Save"**.
</Steps>

:::note[Email delivery]
EasyBiller handles email delivery through its own infrastructure. You do not need to configure an SMTP server or third-party email service.
:::

## Notification preferences

This section lets you control which events trigger notifications to your customers and team:

| Event | SMS | Email | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bill generated** | Configurable | Configurable | Sent when a new bill is created |
| **Payment received** | Configurable | Configurable | Confirmation after successful payment |
| **Payment overdue** | Configurable | Configurable | Reminder after grace period expires |
| **Reading anomaly** | Off | Admin only | Internal alert for unusual readings |
| **Account invitation** | Off | Always on | Sent to new team members |
| **Password reset** | Off | Always on | Security notification |

Toggle each event type independently for SMS and email in the **Notifications** section.

For detailed notification management, see [Notifications](/account/notifications/).

## Metadata and feature flags

Advanced settings that control platform behavior for your company. These are typically configured during onboarding and rarely need changes afterward.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| **Auto-generate bills** | Automatically generate bills at the end of each billing cycle | On |
| **Require photo proof** | Mandate photo capture for every meter reading | On |
| **GPS tagging** | Require GPS coordinates on meter readings | On |
| **Anomaly threshold** | Percentage deviation from average that triggers an anomaly flag | 50% |
| **Reading reminder** | Send SMS reminders to meter readers with pending assignments | On |
| **Customer portal** | Allow customers to view their bills and payment history online | Off |
| **Multi-currency** | Enable billing in multiple currencies (for companies operating across borders) | Off |

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Company Settings > Advanced**.
  2. Toggle the features you want to enable or disable.
  3. For threshold values, enter the desired number.
  4. Click **"Save"**.
</Steps>

:::caution[Feature flags]
Some feature flags are only available on certain plans. If a toggle is grayed out, your current plan may not include that feature. Contact support or your account manager for information about upgrading.
