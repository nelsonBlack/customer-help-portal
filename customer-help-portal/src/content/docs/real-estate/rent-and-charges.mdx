Once your properties are set up and tenants are onboarded, the billing engine takes over. This guide explains how charges are generated, how to record payments through M-Pesa and other channels, and how to stay on top of outstanding balances across your portfolio.

## Understanding charge types

Every charge billed to a tenant falls into one of these categories:

| Charge Type | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Rent** | The primary monthly payment for occupying the unit | KES 35,000/month |
| **Water** | Water usage or fixed water service fee | KES 800/month (fixed) or metered |
| **Garbage** | Waste collection and disposal | KES 500/month |
| **Security** | Guard services, CCTV, access control | KES 1,000/month |
| **Custom** | Any other recurring or one-time charge you define | Parking (KES 3,000), Maintenance (KES 2,000) |

### Recurring vs. one-time charges

- **Recurring charges** are generated automatically every billing cycle based on charge templates. Rent, garbage, and security are typical examples.
- **One-time charges** are created manually for specific situations — a repair bill, a penalty, or a deposit top-up. These appear on the tenant's statement for that month only.

---

## How the charge template fallback works

Charge amounts are determined by a 3-tier priority system. The system checks each level in order and uses the first match it finds:

| Priority | Level | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| 1 (highest) | **Unit-specific** | An amount configured directly on the individual unit |
| 2 | **Unit-type** | An amount configured for all units of a certain type (e.g., all 2-Bedroom units) |
| 3 (lowest) | **Property default** | An amount configured at the property level, applying to all units |

**Practical example:** Your property has a default garbage fee of KES 500. You set an override of KES 700 for 3-Bedroom units. Unit A-301 (a 3-Bedroom) has a special agreement for KES 0. Here is what gets charged:

- **Studio unit** -- KES 500 (property default, no overrides exist)
- **Any 3-Bedroom unit** -- KES 700 (unit-type override)
- **Unit A-301 specifically** -- KES 0 (unit-specific override wins)

For a full walkthrough of setting up charge templates, see the [Property & Unit Setup Guide](/real-estate/property-setup#understanding-charge-templates).

## Monthly charge generation

At the start of each billing cycle (typically the 1st of the month), the system automatically generates charges for all active tenants based on their assigned charge templates.

### What happens during generation

<Steps>

1. **The system scans all active leases** across your properties.

2. **For each tenant, it resolves charge amounts** using the 3-tier fallback system.

3. **Charges are created as line items** on the tenant's monthly statement.

4. **Notifications are sent** to tenants with their billing summary (if SMS/email notifications are enabled).

</Steps>

### Reviewing generated charges

After charge generation, go to **Real Estate > Billing > Monthly Charges** to review. You can:

- View charges grouped by property, unit, or tenant
- Filter by charge type (rent only, utilities only, etc.)
- Spot any anomalies before tenants receive their statements
- Edit or remove incorrectly generated charges before the payment window opens

:::tip[Review before the 5th]
Make it a habit to review generated charges within the first few days of the month. Catching errors early avoids confused tenants and payment disputes.
:::

### Adding a one-time charge

For charges outside the normal billing templates:

<Steps>

1. Open the tenant's profile and go to the **Charges** tab.

2. Click **Add One-Time Charge**.

3. Enter the charge name, amount, and a description explaining what it is for.

4. Save. The charge appears on the tenant's current statement.

</Steps>

## Recording rent payments

Analog Water supports multiple payment methods. The most common in East Africa is M-Pesa, but you can also record cash, bank transfers, and cheque payments.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="M-Pesa (automatic)">

### How M-Pesa integration works

When a tenant pays via M-Pesa using your configured paybill number and account reference, the payment is matched and recorded automatically.

**Setup requirements:**
- M-Pesa paybill number configured in **Settings > Payments > M-Pesa**
- Tenant's phone number matches their profile
- Tenant uses the correct account reference (typically their unit number or tenant ID)

**What happens when a payment comes in:**

<Steps>

1. The tenant sends money to your paybill via M-Pesa.

2. The system receives a confirmation callback from Safaricom.

3. The payment is matched to the tenant based on the phone number and account reference.

4. The payment is applied to the tenant's oldest outstanding charges (FIFO — first in, first out).

5. A receipt is automatically sent to the tenant via SMS.

</Steps>

**If a payment cannot be matched** (wrong account reference, unrecognized phone number), it appears in the **Unmatched Payments** queue for manual reconciliation.

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Cash / Bank / Cheque">

### Recording manual payments

For payments received outside M-Pesa, you record them manually.

<Steps>

1. Go to **Real Estate > Payments** and click **Record Payment**.

2. Search for the tenant by name, phone number, or unit.

3. Enter the payment details:

   | Field | Description |
   |-------|-------------|
   | **Amount** | The total amount received |
   | **Payment Method** | Cash, Bank Transfer, or Cheque |
   | **Reference Number** | Bank transaction ID, cheque number, or receipt number |
   | **Payment Date** | The date the money was actually received |

4. Select which charges to apply the payment to (or let the system auto-allocate using FIFO).

5. Click **Confirm**. A receipt is generated and can be sent to the tenant.

</Steps>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Late fees and penalty configuration

You can configure the system to automatically apply late fees when rent is not paid by a specified date.

### Setting up late fee rules

Go to **Settings > Billing > Late Fees** and configure:

| Setting | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Grace Period** | Number of days after the due date before a penalty applies | 5 days |
| **Penalty Type** | Fixed amount or percentage of outstanding balance | Percentage |
| **Penalty Amount** | The fee or rate to apply | 5% of outstanding rent |
| **Maximum Penalty** | Cap on total accumulated penalties | KES 10,000 |
| **Application Frequency** | One-time or recurring (e.g., monthly until paid) | One-time |

### How penalties are applied

<Steps>

1. The billing due date passes (e.g., 5th of the month).

2. The grace period elapses (e.g., 5 days, so the 10th).

3. For any tenant with an outstanding balance, the system calculates the penalty.

4. The penalty is added as a charge on the tenant's statement.

5. The tenant receives a notification about the late fee (if notifications are enabled).

</Steps>

:::caution[Communicate penalty policies upfront]
Make sure your penalty policy is clearly stated in the lease agreement and communicated to tenants during onboarding. Surprise fees erode trust and create disputes.

## Viewing outstanding balances

### Tenant-level view

Open any tenant's profile and go to the **Statement** tab to see:

- All charges (current and historical)
- All payments received
- Running balance
- Aging breakdown (current, 30 days, 60 days, 90+ days overdue)

### Property-level view

Go to **Real Estate > Billing > Outstanding Balances** for a property-wide summary:

- Total outstanding across all tenants
- List of tenants sorted by balance (highest first)
- Aging summary for the entire property
- Export to CSV for offline analysis or reporting

### Portfolio-level view

The **Dashboard** provides a high-level snapshot across all your properties:

- Total rent expected vs. total collected this month
- Collection rate percentage
- Properties with the highest outstanding balances
- Trend charts showing collection performance over time

---

## Tenant payment history

Every payment, whether automatic (M-Pesa) or manual, is recorded with a full audit trail.

### Viewing payment history

Open the tenant's profile and go to the **Payments** tab. Each entry shows:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Date** | When the payment was received |
| **Amount** | How much was paid |
| **Method** | M-Pesa, Cash, Bank Transfer, or Cheque |
| **Reference** | Transaction ID or receipt number |
| **Applied To** | Which charges the payment was allocated to |
| **Recorded By** | The user who recorded the payment (for manual entries) |

### Generating a tenant statement

Click **Generate Statement** to create a downloadable PDF showing all charges and payments for a selected date range. This is useful for:

- Responding to tenant balance inquiries
- End-of-year tax documentation
- Dispute resolution
- Move-out settlement calculations

---

## Bulk payment recording

When you receive multiple payments at once — for example, processing a bank statement with several tenant transfers — use the bulk payment feature.

<Steps>

1. Go to **Real Estate > Payments > Bulk Upload**.

2. Download the **CSV template** and fill in the payment details: tenant identifier, amount, payment method, reference number, and date.

3. Upload the completed CSV file.

4. The system validates each row and shows a preview:
   - Matched payments (green): Ready to process
   - Warnings (yellow): Possible issues (e.g., overpayment)
   - Errors (red): Cannot be processed (e.g., tenant not found)

5. Review the preview, resolve any errors, and click **Process All**.

6. Receipts are generated and sent to tenants automatically.

</Steps>

:::note[Reconciliation tip]
Run bulk uploads at least once a week if you receive bank transfers regularly. The longer you wait, the harder it becomes to match payments to the correct billing period.
:::

## Deposit management

Security deposits are tracked separately from regular charges to ensure proper handling at move-out.

### Recording deposit collection

Deposits are recorded during the [tenant onboarding process](/real-estate/tenant-onboarding). The system tracks:

- **Expected deposit** — The amount agreed upon in the lease
- **Amount received** — What has actually been collected (supports partial payments)
- **Balance** — Any outstanding deposit amount

### Deposit status tracking

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Pending** | Deposit agreed but not yet received |
| **Partially Paid** | Some of the deposit has been collected |
| **Fully Paid** | The complete deposit amount has been received |
| **Refund Due** | Tenant has moved out and the deposit (or a portion) is to be returned |
| **Refunded** | Deposit has been returned to the tenant |
| **Forfeited** | Deposit retained due to damages or outstanding balances |

### Handling deposit refunds

When a tenant moves out, the deposit refund process is managed through the [Lease Management Guide](/real-estate/lease-management#handling-deposit-refunds). In summary:

1. Conduct a unit inspection
2. Deduct any repair costs or outstanding balances
3. Calculate the refund amount
4. Process the refund through M-Pesa or bank transfer
5. Record the refund in the system
